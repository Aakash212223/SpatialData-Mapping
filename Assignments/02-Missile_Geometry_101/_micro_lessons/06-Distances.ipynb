    "\n",
    "- Last lesson we loaded the WDO package and used some of the  given spatial functions. Now we are going to put package to use and calculate many distances and draw some lines. \n",
    "- Using any file that has \"world cities\" in the name:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - [WorldCitiesGeo](../data/WorldCitiesGeo/) (and all its geojson files in the directory)\n",
    "  - [world_cities_fixed.json](../data/world_cities_fixed.json)\n",
    "  - [world_cities_by_time-zone.json](../data/world_cities_by_time-zone.json)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- These contain ALL THE CITIES IN THE WORLD! Well ... most of the cities.  You know like the ones that ... that have people.  I mean `Burkburnett` probably isn't in the file, but it does have people, so ... (update ... I just checked, and Burk is in the file!)\n",
    "- Keep reading\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read in a file containing the locations to cities all over the world ([world_cities_large.json](./../data/world_cities_large.json)).\n",
    "- We would like to draw a line from MSU (or close to it) to each city in the file, but thats not feasible as the file is too large. \n",
    "- Looking at the options (files) above, you should have plenty of choices for filtering down to a manageable size.\n",
